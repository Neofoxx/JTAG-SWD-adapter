V1:

- An add-on board for the FT2232H-56Q Mini-Module
- Includes only voltage translators, series/pull-down resistors and status LEDs

Changelog for V2:

- V2 was never finished.
- Idea was to add ESD protection, and a PowerSupply stage
-- ESD - quad ESD diodes, for 5V max.
-- Power supply - 600mA Step-down DCDC, 5V/3.3V/2.5V/1.8V options.
-- Selectable through DIP switched on the inside.

Changes from V2 to V3:

- Raw FT2232 chip
- ESD now SRV05-4 instead of PGB1010603 (3pF instead of 0.4pF)
- USB C CONNECTOR!
- Through hole LEDs - saves a fortune on light guides
- Added open soldermask on select edges - should help with ESD
- Power supply section added for powering the target
- Most resistors changed to resistor array (4x0603)

Changelog for V4:

- DCDC converter in the power supply changed to a more suitable one.
- Fixed wiriing error on the USB connector
- Added status LEDs for the second UART channel (RX&TX LEDs)
- Removed dual footprints for the EEPROM
